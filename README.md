@autoBot04768645 twitter account to see posts Requires: an internet connection to post

This console app will tweet to the twitter account above 

The program gives the user some options: tweet, tweet media with a caption or tweet later, and some web scraping options

Reach out to me through slack or email to get the api_keys.txt file.  
-You will have to add the api_keys.txt file for the program to run properly 
-The program will run but you will see red text to 'check credentials or internet connection' via the console
-Without the api_keys.txt file the app will not post to twitter

Also feel free to contact me about the helper programs that post at different times.

Things left to do:

done - instead of full file paths modify them to relative file paths from the github file tree
done - open chrome to www.twitter.com/@autoBot04768645 USE: ProcessInfoStart()
done - add a web scrapper and have it run daily
add a search for tweets function/ retweet
