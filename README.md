@autoBot04768645 is the default twitter account 

-You may choose to use your own account by signing in via api keys

NOTE: for mac select Run from the top menu bar
Run with > custom configuration
make sure 'run in terminal' is checked
Run

The program gives the user some options: tweet, tweet media with a caption, or tweet later(text or media), and some web scraping options
-program gives the option to check twitter(although only works for default account right now)
-may take a little while to build due to the pictures included(I think)
-I used visual studio to build and run the program

Also feel free to contact me about the helper programs that post at different times.

Things left to do:
add a search for tweets function/ retweet,
add a UI using razor pages?
