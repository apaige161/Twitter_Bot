@autoBot04768645 twitter account to see posts Requires: an internet connection to post

This console app will tweet to the twitter account above The program gives the user some options: tweet, tweet media with a caption or tweet later

Reach out to me through slack or email (apaige161@gmail.com) to get the api key file. NOTE: you will have to update the file path of the api_keys.txt file for the program to run properly -The program will run but you will see red text to check credentials or internet connections via the console

Things left to do:

done - instead of full file paths modify them to relative file paths from the github file tree
done - open chrome to www.twitter.com/@autoBot04768645 USE: ProcessInfoStart()
add a search for tweets function/ retweet
